# AI-Powered-Healthcare-Advisor
The modern patient frequently turns to online sources for health information, leading to potential confusion, misinformation, and unnecessary anxiety. Our project addresses this critical gap by providing a reliable, accessible, and immediate source of preliminary health guidance.

Problem Statement: The Burden of Untimely and wrong Information:
There is a lack of accessible and affordable AI-driven healthcare assistance that provides reliable symptom analysis, OTC suggestions, and triage recommendations. Many people rely on unverified online sources, leading to misinformation and delayed care. Elderly individuals and rural populations face additional challenges due to mobility issues, long hospital queues, high costs, and limited access to medical services. An intelligent AI-based healthcare advisor is required to provide safe preliminary guidance and timely critical alerts.

Model Architectures:
Random Forest, Decision Tree, 
Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN

Conclusion: Next Steps and Potential Impact:
Future upgrades include multilingual support and AI-based image diagnosis to improve accessibility, usability, and healthcare assistance accuracy.
